[Back to Course Guidelines](../../README.md#course-guidelines)

Attendance must be maintained at a **95%** rate. (You can miss **no more** than a total of **4 classes**.)


A total of **3 classes** may be taken remotely with prior approval.

Expectations for remote class:

* Consistent interaction with TAs on Slack throughout the durations of class time.

* Possible collaboration with other students if they, too, are attending remote.

* Completion of all classroom activities prior to class end.

## Late Policy

3 Lates adds up to a single absence.

You can be late to **no more** than a total **12 classes** given that you have **0** absences. 

It is recomended that sudents arrive 5 minutes prior to the start of class. 

Students who are late more then 5 minutes will be marked as late.
